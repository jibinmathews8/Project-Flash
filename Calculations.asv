Notes:

1. Induction motor starting on full voltage has effect of drawing 5x-10x
more current
    A. Can cause large voltage drop (needed for calculation)
    B. Two Problems
        i. Motor can not accelerate to full rated speed (Low bus voltage)
        ii. Voltage sag can cause lights to dim, drop out contactors, and
        shut down VFD.

%% Lowest Voltage during start up Equation:
%{
V_Start = (X_LR) / (X_1 + X_t + X_LR) * V

V_Start: Lowest voltage (Given from Wattmeter)
X_LR: Locked Rotor Reactance of the Motor
X_1: Electric Utility Impedence (Can be useful during back calculations)
X_t: Transformer Leakage Reactance 
V: Input Voltage
%}

%% Motor Starting Current Equation:
%{
I_Start = (X_LR) / (X_1 + X_t + X_LR) * V

I_Start: Starting Current (Given from Wattmeter)
X_1: Electric Utility Impedence (Can be useful during back calculations)
X_t: Transformer Leakage Reactance 
V: Input Voltage
%}

%% Motor Starting Power Factor Calculation
%{
PF_Start = cos ( arctan( (X_1 + X_t + X_LR) / R_LR) )

PF_Start: Motor Locked/ Starting Power Factor (10%-30%)
R_LR:
